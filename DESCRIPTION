Description: SIMPEL is an R package for streamlining data analysis of non-stationary stable isotopic pulse 
    or pulse chase labeling experiments and can be used with both targeted and untargeted metabolomics data sets. 
    SIMPEL is capable of calculating and identifying single and dual labeled isotopologues from XCMS feature lists 
    for chemical formulae from the user. SIMPEL can generate Mass Isotopologue Distribution (MID) matrices and 
    calculate average labeling for compounds. The data can serve as an important input for metabolic flux calculations 
    in modeling software. SIMPEL includes post-processing data analysis features to generate MID plots, 
    average labeling diagrams, perform k-means clustering analysis, Principle Component Analysis (PCA) and 
    to visualize label enrichment as a heat map.
